# Plasticity-Chart

The plasticity chart is a fondamental tool for fine-grained soils classification. This chart is based on the values of liquid limit (WL) and plasticity index (IP). 

The "A-line" in this chart is expressed as IP = 0.73 (WL - 20). The "A-line" and vertical lines at WL equal to 35% and 50% separate the soils into various classes.
